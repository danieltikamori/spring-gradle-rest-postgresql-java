# Banking Java API using Gradle, REST and PosgreSQL

RESTful API for Banking services built in Java 17 with Spring Boot 3.

## Main technologies:

 - **Java 17**: We will use the latest LTS version of Java to take advantage of the latest innovations offered by this robust and widely used language;
 - **Spring Boot 3**: We will work with the newest version of Spring Boot, which maximizes developer productivity through its powerful autoconfiguration premise;
 - **Spring Data JPA**: We will explore how this tool can simplify our data access layer, facilitating integration with SQL databases;
 - **OpenAPI (Swagger)**: We will create effective and easy-to-understand API documentation using OpenAPI (Swagger), perfectly aligned with the high productivity offered by Spring Boot;
 - **Railway**: makes it easy to deploy and monitor our solutions in the cloud, as well as offering various databases as a service and CI/CD pipelines.

Figma was used to abstract the domain of this API, being useful in the analysis and design of the solution.
